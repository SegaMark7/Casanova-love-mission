-What's going on, lady? Who are you?
-That's not important right now... Have you heard of Emil Vaximus?

-The infamous super-criminal? Of course I heard of him.
-He stole a very dangerous device which he can use to rule the world. You have to stop him!

-But why me? I'm just a regular guy.
-Your experience with women will come in handy on this mission. Your country needs you!

-But where will I find Vaximus?
-He was last seen in the Underworld club.

-There are rumors that Vaximus works with Raven, a jewel thief. Should I interrogate her first?
-I know of a massage parlor Raven often visits. What is your plan?
